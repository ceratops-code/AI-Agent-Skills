# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Unified deployment operations, release publication, and artifact identity in
  repository-owned `sdlc/sdlc.yml`; added whole-sequence operation preparation,
  one lifecycle-contract CLI selector, ordered phase-specific operation
  selection, structured bounded failures, and per-position shipping
  checkpoints.
- Made update execution collect every declared pytest node during prepare so
  missing classes or functions fail before source edits without running tests.
- Made artifact classification treat Python project manifests as buildable but
  non-publishing until a publish workflow or explicit artifact contract
  supplies external intent, so no-artifact repositories skip registry identity
  and version checks.
- Made installer version 9 execute installed Ceratops lifecycle behavior from a
  temporary runtime snapshot outside the managed destination, use one
  independent checkout fallback when unavailable or unsuccessful, and keep
  external-repository installers Ceratops-independent.
- Made repository shipping reuse completed `after_ship` work across pending
  cleanup retries, made cleanup progress durable per selected branch, and made
  promotion deployment include prior unpublished release batches.
- Made fast-change run repository-declared Markdown lint for Markdown patches
  before installation or commit, with existing compensation on failure.
- Made promotion-provided `base_revision` conditional on the selected operation
  declaration while preserving strict explicit deployment parameters, and
  corrected stale installer bootstrap docstrings.
- Added deterministic repository shipping with a scoped pending-work check
  before the first remote push, retained post-sync and post-deploy rechecks,
  concurrent CI and Codex-review gates, exact-head post-gate admin merge, local
  synchronization, structured post-merge deployment, and selected-source
  cleanup. Standalone PR merge behavior is unchanged.
- Added evidence-gated CodeQL disposition that requires sentinel source-to-sink
  sanitizer proof and explicit authorization before alert dismissal.
- Moved Ceratops skills to a copy-based runtime install model: source skills
  stay delta-only, the lifecycle renderer expands shared sections, and the
  versioned `scripts/install-skills.py` bootstrap installs managed runtime skill
  folders plus declared payloads.
- Renamed the repository owner to `ceratops-repo-lifecycle` and consolidated
  local Git promotion, structured deployment, guarded GitHub shipping, and PR
  lifecycle work there. Skill creation and mutation remain in
  `ceratops-skill-lifecycle`.
- Added separate `promote`, `promote-and-deploy`, `run-operation`, and `ship`
  actions backed by `promote-repository.py`, `manage-pending-work.py`,
  `run-deploy-operation.py`, and `ship-repository.py`.
- Restored preferred fast-change skill maintenance with one classified Python
  orchestrator owning multi-file and multi-skill patching, exact existing
  tests, targeted installation, commit, and failure compensation.
- Made runtime deployment a locked selected-batch transaction with exact
  add/remove/base-revision scope, rollback and interrupted-state convergence;
  moved direct-manifest inventory into the installer and retired the separate
  runtime validator.
- Replaced executable source-shape, syntax-tree, hash, and contract
  source-anchor enforcement with behavioral and structured-data checks.
- Moved the live section manifest and sources to
  `skills/skill-sections.json` and `skills/sections/`, added the live
  `deploy/deploy.yml` contract, moved the reusable section-manifest template
  into the skill-lifecycle bundle, and kept the reusable deployment-contract
  skeleton under repository-lifecycle references.
- Made compatibility materialization preserve target identity and custom
  section assignments, roll back blocker paths, and run from a self-contained
  lifecycle-only installed bundle.
- Split health policy into deterministic and non-deterministic contracts for
  GitHub org settings, live GitHub repo settings, repo contents, code comments,
  and external artifact registries.
- Split contract review by lifecycle owner: GitHub, code, repo, PR, org, and
  artifact contracts now live under `ceratops-repo-lifecycle` as
  `contracts-review`; skill consistency, governance, and skill-design contracts
  now live under `ceratops-skill-lifecycle` as
  `skills-consistency-review`.
- Retired the standalone `ceratops-contract-review` and
  `ceratops-skills-consistency-audit` skill folders, moving their contracts,
  validators, and source-doc registries into the owning lifecycle skills.
- Reduced routine skill maintenance validation to same-surface checks, with full
  validation reserved for CI, governance automation, explicit broad
  verification, validation-script changes, or real cross-surface uncertainty.
- Replaced the skill-specific release wrappers with deterministic generic
  repository lifecycle helpers and exact selected-branch/worktree scope.
- Clarified that successful mutation commands are enough evidence for the exact
  setting or file they changed; contract validators are for drift, audit,
  uncertain state, and broad current-health claims.
- Updated `AGENTS.md`, README, contributing guidance, shared sections, runtime
  payload declarations, and skill metadata to match the new install, contract,
  and validation behavior.
- Expanded no-extra-cost GitHub, Dependabot, artifact-registry, trusted
  publishing, provenance, and paid-feature classification coverage across the
  contracts.
- Added `ceratops-automation-run`, split handoff skills,
  `ceratops-code-consistency-audit`, consolidated skill lifecycle actions, local
  runtime staging, and skill remote shipping workflows for recurring Codex
  operations.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-04-19

- Required all Ceratops GitHub workflow skills to report each retained security,
  code-scanning, maturity, or process alert with name or id, blocking status,
  defer reason, and concrete clearance work.
- Expanded `ceratops-gh-repo-health-audit` to perform an explicit end-to-end
  alert audit and forbid collapsing retained alerts into a generic healthy
  result.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-04-18

- Tightened publication checks across the publish, ship, audit, and merge
  skills.
- Added explicit retained-state reporting for Scorecard maturity gaps in
  publish, ship, and audit flows.
- Compressed repeated skill policy text into a synced shared core block.
- Added explicit skill boundaries and handoff rules between publish, ship,
  audit, dependencies-maintenance, and merge flows.
- Added `templates/common-core.md` and `scripts/sync-skill-core.py` so shared
  policy text stays consistent across skills.
- Updated validation and CI to enforce common-core sync.
- Narrowed `ceratops-code` ownership preference to explicit Ceratops context
  instead of acting as a universal default.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-04-18

- Initial public release of five Ceratops GitHub workflow skills.
- Added Codex metadata for each skill.
- Added repository validation, GitHub Actions CI, CodeQL workflow, Dependabot
  config, security policy, contribution docs, issue forms, pull request
  template, and CODEOWNERS.
