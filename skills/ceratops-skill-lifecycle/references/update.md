# Update Action

## Goal

Maintain existing skills as one consistency surface instead of patching
individual skill files in isolation. Decide first whether the source of truth is
skill-local text, a shared section, the section manifest, runtime payloads,
runtime generation logic, validation logic, helper-runtime claims, contracts, or
repo docs, then update the narrowest correct source that exists.

## Context

### Inputs To Capture

- Existing skills or shared files in scope: `skills/*`,
  `skills/skill-sections.json`, `skills/sections/`,
  `skills/ceratops-skill-lifecycle/references/templates/ceratops-logo-500.png`,
  repository-lifecycle compatibility templates,
  `scripts/install-skills-bootstrap.py`,
  `skills/ceratops-skill-lifecycle/scripts/runtime/managed_runtime_builder.py`,
  installer resolution, synchronization, and repository-consistency helpers,
  `skills/ceratops-skill-lifecycle/scripts/skills-consistency-source-validator.py`,
  skill-local `references/`, helper-runtime files, and repo docs.
- Whether the change belongs in skill-local text, shared sections, manifests,
  runtime generation, validation, helper-runtime code or claims, contracts, or
  docs.
- Target repo `runtime_source_id` and `validation_profile`; the `ceratops`
  profile adds Ceratops icon, contract, retired-artifact, and repository
  governance checks while `ceratops-compatible` uses the common full checks.
- Whether the task should stop at committed task-worktree changes or hand off
  to `$ceratops-repo-lifecycle`.

## Constraints

### Boundaries

- Use this action to update existing Ceratops skills, compatible skills in
  another repo, or the shared skill-maintenance layer itself.
- If the task creates a brand-new skill, return to the parent skill and select
  `create`.
- If the task is Ceratops skill-contract standards upkeep, return to the parent
  skill and select `skills-contract-review`.
- If the task is manifest-backed installed-skill consistency or contract
  compliance, return to the parent skill and select
  `skills-consistency-review`.
- If the task only promotes, deploys, or ships already-prepared committed
  changes, use `$ceratops-repo-lifecycle`.

### Workflow

#### 1. Inspect the maintenance surface

- Inspect targeted skills, available shared section files, section manifest,
  runtime generation and validation scripts, touched helper-runtime files or
  claims, and repo docs that describe current structure.
- Start with targeted `rg` or path inventory and small line-window reads;
  broaden to full-file reads only for governing control files, ownership
  decisions, or unresolved context.
- Identify source-of-truth files versus generated output.
- Require a compatible section manifest before using the shared validator or
  installer. Do not infer compatibility from skill-name prefixes or from the
  presence of the lifecycle source skill.
- Classify the requested change as skill-local, shared, structural,
  validation-only, helper-runtime-adjacent, or docs-only.
- Resolve runtime scope before mutation: additions, removals, renames,
  per-skill assignments, payloads, and shared-section consumers select exact
  skills; wildcard payloads, source identity, profile, or global generation
  semantics select all managed skills; unresolved effects require a decision.

#### 2. Decide ownership before editing

- Prefer shared sections and the manifest when a rule is repeated, semantically
  equivalent, or harmless as a common default for every assigned skill; keep
  per-skill source text limited to true deltas.
- Add or expand a shared section only when that ownership reduces meaningful
  duplication, clarifies ownership, or prevents cross-skill drift.
- Keep trivial one-off text inline unless duplication is already causing drift
  or ownership confusion.

#### 3. Apply updates at the real source

- (D) Before the first edit of helper-runtime code or a multi-file contract
  update, create one request declaring selected skills, allowed paths, cohesive
  change groups, structured checks, the verified task-temp root, the exact
  evidence output, the disposable request, state, and evidence roles, and a
  helper-owned active-update retention marker; run
  `python scripts/skill-update-workflow.py prepare --request REQUEST --state
  STATE`. After the last edit, run `python scripts/skill-update-workflow.py
  verify --state STATE --evidence-output EVIDENCE`. The helper must preserve the
  recorded pre-existing worktree baseline, reject undeclared new changes or
  source drift, collect every declared pytest node before edits without
  executing tests, run the declared checks once, treat declared zero-match
  searches as success, write detailed evidence, and emit only `OK` or one
  compact actionable error. After a passed verification, `verify` may start one
  correction generation only when the current task HEAD or complete prepared
  scope snapshot differs from the passed evidence. It must atomically make the
  earlier success non-finalizable before correction checks, accept only the
  prepared HEAD or a descendant whose committed paths stay declared, rerun the
  declared checks, preserve retryable pending state on failure, reject unchanged
  retries and scope broadening, and permanently invalidate state changed after
  the correction generation. Do not use it for skill-local text-only updates.
- Update skills, shared sections, manifest, runtime payloads, runtime generation
  or validation scripts, helper-runtime files or claims, contracts, and repo
  docs only where ownership requires it.
- When addressing review feedback, patch the referenced artifact first. Touch
  adjacent skills, action references, contracts, or docs only when targeted
  evidence proves the same source-of-truth defect applies there; otherwise
  report them as separate candidates requiring approval.
- Before renaming a skill or named skill surface, build one old-to-new reference
  map and update folder name, frontmatter `name`, README rows, manifest
  assignments, runtime payload keys, cross-skill references,
  `agents/openai.yaml`, helper comments and prompts, validators, and docs.
- Do not leave alias folders, old-name shims, or pointer artifacts.
- When removing, merging, or narrowing sections, update every affected
  assignment and keep runtime generated section source comments readable.
- If runtime generation or validation flow no longer matches the section model,
  fix the scripts instead of working around them in skill text.

#### 4. Run needed checks

- Change both explicit `INSTALLER_VERSION` values together and reuse an
  unpublished bump when replacing its architecture. Run both public CLI
  behavior tests. AI-Agent-Skills executes a temporary snapshot of its
  installed lifecycle outside the managed destination and uses its independent
  installer once when that path is unavailable or unsuccessful;
  compatible-repository installers remain self-contained and
  Ceratops-independent.
- If shared section files or `skills/skill-sections.json` changed, run the
  manifest's shared-source check path.
- Do not run validation solely because skill-local text, metadata, or docs
  changed; use targeted readback, stale-reference search, and diff review unless
  a broader check is stale.
- If helper-runtime code or claims changed, run only the touched helper's smoke
  command and exact existing behavior tests.
- If runtime generation, installer, or transaction code changed, run the
  affected transaction tests and one all-managed temporary installation.
- (D) After successful verification and the final requested commit,
  deployment, or other caller use completes, run `python
  scripts/skill-update-workflow.py finalize --state STATE`. This invocation is
  the explicit completion trigger. The helper must reject incomplete or changed
  ownership state, links, path escapes, repository files, and failed
  verification; preserve undeclared inputs; remove only the exact owned
  request, state, evidence, and retention-marker files; and remove the verified
  task-temp root only when empty afterward. A successful update run is not complete
  until finalization returns `OK`; do not finalize failed or incomplete runs.
- After committing, use `$ceratops-repo-lifecycle` `promote` when only local
  release staging is requested, `promote-and-deploy` when the repository's
  declared deployment should run, or `ship` when the staged release should be
  shipped.
- Reserve full source validation for explicit broad validation,
  validation-script changes, or concrete structured cross-surface uncertainty;
  never use executable source form as behavior evidence.
- Re-open changed files and confirm source skills, manifest assignments, runtime
  payloads, docs, contracts, and metadata still align.

## Done When

### Completion Gate

- Every changed skill and shared file still points at the intended source of
  truth.
- Runtime shared-section generation is updated through shared sources, manifest,
  and runtime builder when those surfaces exist and changed.
- Manifest, runtime builder, validation script, repo docs, and touched metadata
  remain aligned when present.
- Ceratops skill-local icons match the canonical skill-lifecycle logo template
  and metadata icon paths are runtime-local.
- Removed, merged, or renamed sections leave no stale assignment or stale
  runtime payload.

### Output Contract

Report only:

- skills or shared maintenance surfaces updated
- new, removed, merged, or narrowed shared sections with reasons
- intentionally retained inconsistencies or follow-up items with reasons
