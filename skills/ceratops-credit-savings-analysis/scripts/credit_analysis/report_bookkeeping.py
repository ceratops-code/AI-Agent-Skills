    The caller validates each record's fields, evidence, boolean, and reason.
    Child reviewers must return one record per category. Final output can copy
    multiple accepted source assessments; differing records must be traceable
    to those sources before they can be combined. Applicability across reviewed
    portions is existential, never a vote. A new final assessment may add support
    but cannot erase applicability established by an accepted source.

    Controller-generated ``source_reviews`` retains every original assessment
    and its task identity, even when the final model copies only one checklist.
    Canonical revalidation checks supplied provenance against accepted records.
