# Ceratops Credit Savings Analysis

## Goal

Analyze completed model-call evidence for avoidable credit spend. Use
`full-analysis` for a generic single-thread or closure request, and one named
surface only when the user names it. This skill recommends controls but never
applies them.

## Public Action Routing

### Action References

- Run the all-run fixed-surface analysis:
  `references/full-analysis.md`
- Analyze deterministic helper contracts: `references/helper-contracts.md`
- Analyze context and evidence reuse: `references/context-evidence.md`
- Analyze rework and validation: `references/rework-validation.md`
- Analyze tool and handoff flow: `references/tool-flow.md`
- Analyze instructions and reasoning flow: `references/instruction-reasoning.md`

## Shared Evidence And Controller Invariants

- Resolve one exact source or one controller-frozen per-thread source set. The
  current thread is only the valid `CODEX_THREAD_ID`; never infer it from
  recency. Exact-name and recent-thread selection use the versioned source
  contract. An incremental closure begins strictly after the previous completed
  closure; active runs and the boundary run are excluded.
- For a single-thread full or standalone analysis, run
  `python scripts/credit-analysis-workflow.py run --request REQUEST`.
- On every fresh single-thread or per-thread-batch plan, validate the installed
  contract and bind its version and hash to controller state. Resume only from
  state whose immutable artifacts still validate. Require mutation authority
  `false`, use a task root under `<repo-parent>/tmp/<repo-name>/<thread-name>`,
  and keep retained evidence inside it.
  Analyze every available retained descendant discovered from source lineage as
  ordinary source runs; report unavailable references and exclude only
  descendants created by the current analysis.
- Planning retains complete protected evidence and read-only canonical
  snapshots. Full analysis treats every completed run as one semantic unit,
  freezes run order and UTF-8 byte counts, and divides only an oversized run
  into
  the minimum ordered input parts that each fit Luna. Calls remain attached to
  their run context. If seventy Luna attempts cannot cover all prepared
  evidence,
  prioritize the largest runs and their immediate successors, admit as many
  ordered parts as the remaining slots allow, and record the exact unreviewed
  remainder. Retain input bytes, planned Luna-output bytes, and actual output
  bytes for every run part. Reserve the controller prompt and output schema
  inside each proven UTF-8 input envelope.
- The end-to-end `run` command executes or resumes the frozen plan. Keep
  `plan --request` for planning-only inspection and `execute --state` for direct
  state-path resume. Treat controller state, evidence and manifest hashes, task
  identities, candidate membership, prompts, results, and attempt telemetry as
  authoritative. Execution never recollects the session. Never skip, repeat,
  reorder, or add a semantic task outside the manifest.
- Before freezing child tasks, resolve and hash the effective global and
  run-local `AGENTS.md` chain. If a recorded canonical worktree cwd is gone, use
  its primary checkout only after exact repository-identity verification and
  record the substitution. Launch Luna from each verified run cwd and Sol from
  the verified primary cwd; retain the effective chain hash on every task and
  attempt and give Sol the hash and any differing run-local rule text. Stop on
  an unresolved source or rule-evidence omission; never fall back to task
  temporary root.
- The controller validates `gpt-5.6-luna` and `gpt-5.6-sol` at maximum effort
  from the local Codex catalog. Luna and Sol children retain native rollout
  state. Every child is approval-free and read-only. The
  controller owns waiting, timeout, process-tree termination, non-model progress,
  prompts, evidence, results, and telemetry, and never spends model calls polling
  children. Accepted calls and attempts retain immutable hashes and resumable
  attempt records.
- Luna performs high-recall discovery across all five fixed surfaces together.
  Run up to fifteen Luna children concurrently and admit no more than seventy
  Luna attempts for one frozen thread tree, including corrective reruns. Launch
  Luna with a retained native session so a later analysis can collect it as an
  ordinary descendant thread. Before launch, assign every admitted run part to
  one of up to six Sol reviewers. Calculate each Luna's output-byte allowance
  from its reviewer's fixed input and remaining proven capacity, then freeze and
  prove every assignment at its planned maximum. If a Luna result violates its
  schema or allowance, rerun that task once with a smaller output allowance; if
  it still fails, report that run part as unreviewed and continue. Never
  truncate
  a result, detach calls from their run context, or create per-surface Luna
  calls.
- A temporary-control review governs only its described owner/control subclaim
  and does not veto an independent finding carried by the same candidate. Route
  every retained Luna candidate exactly once to its preassigned reviewer. Apply
  the unassessed-call ceiling only to the aggregate routed call set. When that
  aggregate exceeds the ceiling and one Sol slot remains, use it to review only
  the unassessed calls with their complete run-part context and replace those
  classifications; prioritize this recovery over optional direct-evidence
  review. After the parallel reviewers and any recovery or direct-evidence
  review finish, run one dependent final Sol to merge their compact judgments,
  produce the report, and deeply verify the top three deduplicated owner/control
  findings against exact evidence. Each rejected Sol task receives one automatic
  corrective retry when the eight-attempt ceiling permits. After a non-final
  task fails validation twice, retain its exact unreviewed candidate, call, and
  byte inventory, exclude that inventory from final transport, and continue to
  the final merger. Use no more than eight Sol
  calls total, counting every attempt. The final Sol does not re-adjudicate
  every
  candidate or receive the complete source tree.
- Restore canonical identifiers and derive nonsemantic summaries, ordering,
  surfaces, workstreams, repeated evidence, and savings arithmetic in code. Sol
  adjudicators merge overlaps and temporary controls, apply recurrence and ROI
  rules, and classify source calls in grouped form. Persist result-size,
  duration, visible-token, and reasoning-token telemetry as diagnostics. Run no
  model bookkeeping calls; stop before execution when the finite plan is
  malformed or changes admitted run, part, or candidate coverage.
- The planner attempts every completed run. When the seventy-Luna cap prevents
  complete transport, retain exact partial-coverage records by run and part
  identity, record count, input bytes, candidate count, and output bytes.
  Continue
  with every admitted part and never imply that the unreviewed remainder was
  semantically reviewed. When eight Sol calls cannot preserve all accepted Luna
  findings, retain the exact candidate and byte inventory of the unreviewed
  overflow.
- Keep session evidence, accepted surface results, the append-only index, and
  the final machine result at their controller-retained paths. Do not echo raw
  session material or caller-local paths unnecessarily.
- Preserve the existing `prepare-batch`, `advance-batch`, `status-batch`, and
  `finalize-batch` compatibility interface for recent-thread selection and
  aggregation. `prepare-batch` plans one ordinary holistic controller per
  selected thread. Execute each pending child with `execute`, then pass its
  retained final result to `advance-batch`; never prepare or collect through a
  parallel child workflow. The batch-summary contract remains a lower-level
  interface; group similar findings for presentation while preserving each
  thread's findings and totals.

## Common Classification And ROI Rules

- Count spend as avoidable only when available instructions, fresh evidence,
  stable contracts, direct helper composition, same-pass revision, or a cheap
  targeted check could have prevented or reduced it. Exclude ordinary model
  mistakes unless a concise durable producer control would materially reduce
  recurrence.
- Exclude calls required by active freshness, safety, verification, controlled
  iteration, or workflow gates. Record conversational tool-protocol overhead as
  necessary rather than as a helper defect. Surface passes and synthesis make
  evidence-backed semantic classifications; deterministic code only groups
  observable evidence, expands selected clusters, and validates the result.
  Calls with an explicit decision-blocking evidence gap remain `unassessed`.
  Calls reviewed by every relevant surface without confirmed waste or a
  necessary exclusion are `reviewed-no-confirmed-waste`; this category is
  neither necessity nor savings.
- Add the credit-specific evidence IDs, implementation status, call counts,
  recurrence, confidence, implementation cost, and ongoing-complexity fields
  required by the controller schema and Output Contract. Before proposing a
  missing control,
  validate its status against frozen current-source evidence for the relevant
  instructions, skills, automations, and helper contracts. When a durable
  safeguard already exists, mark the finding `implemented` and classify
  violating behavior as a compliance or runtime gap instead of proposing a
  duplicate control. Use Minimal only for a local one- or two-line correction
  with local verification; broader ownership, failure, or verification work is
  at least Low.
- Treat an overbroad command or tool result contract as tool-flow waste and
  unnecessarily selected or loaded model context as context-evidence waste.
  Preserve a supported overlap as secondary evidence without double-counting
  model calls. Mark a volume-only finding as `context-volume`, keep all of its
  call-savings fields at zero, and classify its evidence calls independently.
- Compute net calls saved per affected run as prevented calls minus recurring
  calls introduced by the fix, and calls saved per similar run as that net
  multiplied by estimated affected-run frequency. State assumptions, test ROI
  at the low end of the frequency range, and reject non-positive lifetime value
  unless correctness or safety independently requires the control.
- Report priced credit only when the controller accepted a valid caller-supplied
  pricing profile. Never describe token volume as monetary or credit cost
  without that profile.

## Cross-Surface Completion

### Completion Gate

- A surface is complete only when Luna has received every admitted run part,
  each retained candidate has one Sol adjudication, every confirmed finding and
  plausible risk for that lens remains in the final result, and every capacity
  omission is explicit. Do not require a semantic dismissal record for every
  call-surface pair.
- `full-analysis` is complete only after the frozen manifest accounts for every
  completed run as reviewed or exactly omitted, proves ordered non-overlapping
  parts and candidate routing, and records immutable Luna, Sol-reviewer,
  direct-evidence-reviewer, and final-task identities and hashes.
  Temporary-control contributions are merged once by owner/control; every
  retained candidate has one disposition;
  every confirmed finding remains; every reviewed source call has one primary
  grouped classification; capacity-omitted calls are excluded from semantic
  classification; overlaps do not double-count savings; and finalization
  succeeds idempotently.
- A standalone action is complete only after the selected surface result is
  accepted and controller finalization succeeds.

### Output Contract

- Retain every confirmed finding in machine evidence. Before the detailed list,
  report `Confirmed: N; outstanding: M; already addressed: K`. Show details only
  for outstanding findings unless the user requests all findings.
- Give each outstanding finding a plain-language title followed by:
  - `Problem:` two to four sentences naming the owner, concrete episode, what
    failed, and why the resulting work was avoidable.
  - `Evidence:` the affected-call count and relevant command, tool, artifact,
    answer, and user-correction sequence; show IDs only on request.
  - `Fix:` the exact durable control, its owner, and how it completes the flow
    end to end.
  - `Verification:` the exact behavior test proving every included gap.
  - `Savings:` observed calls, expected similar-run savings, implementation
    cost, ongoing complexity, and material assumptions.
- Do not show status labels, confidence, internal IDs, or helper taxonomy unless
  requested.
- Keep every finding concise, self-contained, and understandable without
  follow-up. Explain what happened and why the work was avoidable before using
  implementation jargon; define each necessary non-obvious term; name the
  broadest correct implementation scope and concrete next artifact or action;
  and omit routine operational detail.
- Present each plausible risk separately with `Observed:` for the concrete
  sequence, `Unknown:` for competing explanations, `Why not confirmed:` for the
  exact missing fact and why choosing an explanation would be speculation, and
  `How to confirm:` for the exact metadata or test. Do not merge risks when that
  hides a distinct unknown or evidence source, and do not include a risk in
  confirmed savings. For standalone actions, state that the conclusion is
  limited to the selected surface and is not a whole-thread reconciliation.
- For full analysis, report necessary, protocol-overhead, avoidable,
  reviewed-no-confirmed-waste, and unassessed totals separately. Report completed
  runs, every admitted or omitted part's record count, input bytes, output
  allowance, actual output bytes, evidence and output totals, and semantic
  coverage. Never imply that omitted runs, parts, calls, or candidates were reviewed.

## Analysis-Only Boundaries

### Research Boundaries

- Use frozen local evidence first. Run only a targeted official-source check
  when a concrete finding depends on current external behavior. Do not perform
  deep or broad research; when broader research is required, report the exact
  uncertainty and a concise paste-ready research prompt as the concrete next
  action.
- Treat intentional full skill-body injection as required runtime context, not
  avoidable spend. Never recommend changes to reasoning settings or levels.

### Boundaries

- Never modify the analyzed prompt, helper, script, skill, instructions,
  repository, automation, workflow, or tool configuration. Route any later
  implementation through the owning lifecycle after a separate execution
  request.
- Collection and synthesis are internal controller phases. Do not expose Luna
  chunking, consolidation, `collect`, `reconcile`, `synthesis`, `apply`, or
  `modify` as public actions.
- Stop blocked when a selected source cannot be resolved, the completed-run
  selection is invalid, controller evidence is stale or mismatched, or required
  semantic evidence is unavailable. Do not substitute visible conversation
  context for controller evidence.
