## Credential Handling

- Do not ask for credentials unless they are truly required after local checks.
- If credentials are truly required after local checks, report only:

1. which credential or login is missing
2. why it is needed
3. where it will be stored
4. the exact command the user should run
5. whether it goes into a local credential store, config file, keyring, CI secret, registry setting, connector, or another exact target
