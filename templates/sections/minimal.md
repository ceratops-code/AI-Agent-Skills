## Instruction enforcement

- All instruction bullets in this file are mandatory, blocking, and
  closure-gating for the phase, action, decision, artifact, or response they govern.
- Do not proceed with or claim completion for any action, decision, artifact, or
  response when an applicable instruction bullet is unmet, unverifiable, or in
  conflict; report the blocker or conflict instead.

## Core Rules
- Everything in this section is part of the skill contract unless explicitly inapplicable to the current task.
- When this skill is invoked, follow this `SKILL.md` as the workflow contract for the task; if a higher-precedence instruction conflicts with a required skill step, report the conflict instead of silently skipping the step.
- Do not claim completion unless this skill's completion gate is satisfied, intentionally inapplicable, or reported as a blocker.
- Scope completion, current-state, root-cause, no-fix, unsupported, and durable-resolution claims to evidence actually checked, or to fresh same-task evidence that still applies.
- Reuse fresh sufficient same-run evidence unless state is uncertain, plausibly changed, materially broadened, externally mutable for the decision, or this skill explicitly requires a fresh check.
- Prefer direct local evidence and targeted diagnostics for the next skill decision; use current official sources only when local evidence leaves a concrete ambiguity or the task depends on unstable external behavior.
- Do not do generalized best-practice refresh, reference-repo comparison, or skill-maintenance work during routine skill runs unless the user explicitly asks or a required decision remains ambiguous after targeted evidence.
- Ask before risky, destructive, irreversible, credential-dependent, externally mutating, complex, invasive, nonstandard, or high-maintenance steps unless the user already explicitly requested that tradeoff.
- Do not update this `SKILL.md` or other skill/control files during a routine run unless the user explicitly asked for skill maintenance or the task cannot be completed safely without a narrow in-scope fix.
- (D) For skill runtime workflows, invoke shared helpers through installed console commands, `python -m <module>` entrypoints, or scripts copied into the installed skill folder; do not locate shared helpers by absolute paths or by the repo's parent directory.
- (D) When a workflow needs a shared repo-maintenance script, run `scripts/<name>` from the active source checkout root when available, otherwise from the installed skill folder; when a helper is skill-local, run it from that skill folder or the corresponding source skill folder; stop as blocked if neither declared location contains it.
- When editing an existing text file, preserve its current line-ending convention unless intentional normalization is part of the task.
- Follow this skill's output contract when present; otherwise report only the outcome, unresolved blockers, retained state with reasons, and important unverified items.

## Credential Handling

- Do not ask for credentials unless they are truly required after local checks.
- If credentials are truly required after local checks, report only:

1. which credential or login is missing
2. why it is needed
3. where it will be stored
4. the exact command the user should run
5. whether it goes into a local credential store, config file, keyring, CI secret, registry setting, connector, or another exact target
- If the user refuses a missing permission, credential, login, or scope, stop retrying and report the blocked action and exact entities still pending.
