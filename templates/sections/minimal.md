<!-- INTERNAL: include in every skill -->

## Core Rules

- Everything in this section is mandatory unless explicitly marked optional or inapplicable.
- Before completion, verify the work against this `SKILL.md` and any governing files already used in the run. Re-open only files changed in this run or whose current contents remain concretely in doubt.
- Blocking: Reuse fresh sufficient same-run evidence across adjacent, resumed, or chained workflows when it still proves the current decision; do not reacquire evidence or rerun checks solely to refresh already-sufficient evidence unless state is uncertain, plausibly changed, externally mutable for the decision, materially broadened, or required fresh by a higher-precedence instruction, skill, automation, or completion gate.
- Use local state, local files, installed tools, and other direct evidence first. Check current official docs or other live official sources only when the task depends on unstable external behavior and the available direct evidence still leaves a concrete task-blocking ambiguity or material conflict.
- Do not do generalized best-practice refresh, reference-repo comparison, or skill-maintenance work during routine runs.
- Do not update this `SKILL.md` during routine runs unless the user explicitly asked for skill maintenance or the current task cannot be completed safely without a narrow in-scope fix.
- Inspect local state and local auth before asking for credentials or making assumptions.
- When editing an existing text file, preserve its current line-ending convention unless intentional normalization is part of the task.
- Classify each touched artifact, external entity, and side effect as active, intentionally retained with reason, stale and removed, not applicable, or blocked.
- In user-facing answers, keep routine success reporting implicit. Omit PR metadata, commit IDs, check lists, cleanup logs, and exact local paths unless they materially change the user's next action, explain a blocker, or were explicitly requested.
- If any required item is unmet or unverifiable, report the blocker instead of claiming completion.
