## Core Rules

- Everything in this skill is mandatory unless explicitly marked optional or inapplicable.
- Before completion, re-open this `SKILL.md` and verify the work line by line against `Core Rules`, `Inputs To Capture`, `Boundaries`, `Workflow`, `Credential Handling`, `Completion Gate`, and `Output Contract`.
- When the task depends on unstable standards, current best practices, or fast-changing external systems, check current official docs and use strong current reference repos when useful.
- If runtime research reveals a durable missing general rule or durable best-practice improvement, update this `SKILL.md`, validate the skill, and report the maintenance. Do not update for one-off preferences, speculative trends, paid-only practices, or project-specific conventions.
- Inspect local state and local auth before asking for credentials or making assumptions.
- When editing an existing text file, preserve its current line-ending convention unless intentional normalization is part of the task.
- Classify each touched artifact, external entity, and side effect as active, intentionally retained with reason, stale and removed, not applicable, or blocked.
- When a skill touches a public GitHub repo and reports repo, security, maturity, or process health, inspect the live community profile and equivalent no-cost moderation or community-health signals instead of inferring health from files, CI, or alert counts alone.
- For every open security, code-scanning, maturity, or process alert you inspect, decide whether it is safe, fix low-risk items directly, and for every alert not fixed report its name or id, whether it is blocking, why it is not being fixed now, and the concrete work needed to clear it. Do not collapse retained alerts into a generic healthy result.
- In user-facing answers, keep routine success reporting implicit. Omit PR metadata, commit IDs, check lists, cleanup logs, and exact local paths unless they materially change the user's next action, explain a blocker, or were explicitly requested.
- If any required item is unmet or unverifiable, report the blocker instead of claiming completion.
