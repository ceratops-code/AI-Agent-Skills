## GH Credential Handling

If credentials are truly required after local checks, report only:

1. which GitHub or registry credential or login is missing
2. why it is needed
3. where it will be stored
4. the exact command the user should run
5. whether it goes into a local credential store, config file, keyring, CI secret, registry setting, or connector

Do not ask for credentials if a working local auth path exists.
